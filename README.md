# Dare_game
This project is to create a simple Browser game that could be used people to play truth/dare like games (phone and pc), link at: https://zzgitgitzz.github.io/dare_game/

you pick up a card from a physical card deck. From left to right the colors represent difficulty, and the numbers represent categories.
To see all categories click on bottom right "sounds" where you can turn on some sounds, and also see categories, and some more things.

So far the game is made to the likes of me and my girlfriend, and I will change code to make it more user friendly to add own dares (if people are interested) later.
